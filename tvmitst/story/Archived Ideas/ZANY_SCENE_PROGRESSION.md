## Zany Integration Notes

### Comedy Elements That Serve Wisdom:

- **Purple eyeliner running** = Visual metaphor for emotional vulnerability
- **Casserole explosions** = External manifestation of internal resistance
- **Giraffe judgment** = How we project criticism onto neutral experiences
- **FBI philosophical investigations** = Life's tendency to teach through unexpected channels
- **Random neighbor kissing** = Authentic expression transcending cultural barriers
- **Carrot obsession** = Our attachment to comfort zones and familiar patterns

### Maintaining Lightness While Going Deep:

- Every profound realization happens during something ridiculous
- Characters maintain their quirks even during wisdom moments
- Spanish learning occurs naturally through absurd situations
- Deep teaching emerges from comedy, never replaces it
- Fernando's weirdness is celebrated, not corrected

This structure ensures players laugh their way into profound wisdom about growth and resilience, with Spanish serving as the delightful vehicle for universal teachings about dancing with life's beautiful chaos!
