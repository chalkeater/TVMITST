# Zany Character Guide: The Absurdist Teachers

## Character Design Philosophy

Each character embodies profound wisdom about growth and discomfort, but expresses it through delightfully weird, unexpected behavior. They're simultaneously ridiculous and deeply wise - like enlightened cartoon characters.

- No character becomes "normal" when they become wise
- Fernando's growth enhances rather than diminishes his beautiful weirdness

### Cultural Authenticity Through Absurdism

- Characters represent authentic aspects of diverse Spanish-speaking cultures
- Cultural elements serve the story and comedy, avoiding stereotypes
- Language patterns reflect real regional variations and personal quirks
- Universal human experiences expressed through specific cultural contexts
- Absurdist elements transcend cultural boundaries while respecting cultural specificity

This character framework ensures that players encounter profound wisdom about growth and resilience through characters so delightfully weird that the teachings sneak past mental resistance - just like Fernando's Spanish skills develop when he stops trying so hard!
