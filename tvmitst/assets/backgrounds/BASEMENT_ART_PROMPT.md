# Basement Scene 1 - AI Art Generation Prompt

## Primary Prompt for Image Generation

**Style:** Hand-drawn 2D point-and-click adventure game background, inspired by Steve Purcell's Monkey Island art style mixed with Sierra's Freddy Pharkas, with surrealist touches from Paco Pomet's figurative work and Alexandre Diop's vibrant contemporary palette. Warm absurdist comedy aesthetic, painterly digital art, rich textures, expressive linework.

**Scene Description:**
A cluttered but oddly comforting basement apartment - "Rock Bottom Central" - where a recently divorced 34-year-old's life has spectacularly unraveled. The space is a beautiful disaster: attempted organization meets unavoidable chaos. Concrete walls with peeling paint in warm earth tones (ochre, terracotta, dusty blues). Low ceiling with exposed pipes and yellowed fluorescent lighting creating dramatic shadows.

**Key Visual Elements:**

1. **Spanish Sticky Notes Everywhere** - Dozens of bright yellow Post-it notes plastered haphazardly across walls, furniture, and objects with Spanish words written in various handwritings (mysterious messages from previous tenant). Some notes are falling off, some overlap, creating visual chaos that's almost beautiful.

2. **WiFi Router** (Lower left corner) - A blinking green router sitting on a low shelf or crate, surrounded by tangled cables. A larger sticky note attached showing "Contraseña: cambios diarios" (Password: changes daily) in both frustration and humor.

3. **Storage Box** (Center-right) - Large cardboard moving box labeled "DAVE'S PERFECTLY ORGANIZED LIFE" (crossed out) with Spanish labels stuck all over it. Box is half-unpacked with items spilling out: old organizational planners, divorce papers peeking out, a broken smartphone screen visible.

4. **Sticky Note #1 Location** (Upper area) - One particularly prominent yellow note stuck to the wall, readable and mysterious, glowing slightly as if it holds secrets.

5. **Background Details:**
   - Worn concrete floor with stained carpet remnants
   - Single dusty window (top) with filtered warm afternoon light creating god rays
   - Mismatched furniture: a sagging couch, milk crate nightstand, folding chair
   - Failed attempts at "basement optimization" - labeled plastic bins, color-coded but abandoned
   - Motivational poster fallen sideways reading "SYSTEMATIC SUCCESS"
   - Calendar showing multiple crossed-out job interview dates
   - Empty coffee cups with Spanish phrases written on them in marker

**Color Palette:**

- Warm earth tones: ochre walls, terracotta accents, dusty rose
- Pops of vibrant color: bright yellow sticky notes, electric green router lights, deep Spanish tile blues
- Shadowy corners with rich purples and deep browns
- Filtered golden afternoon light creating warm highlights
- Inspired by Alexandre Diop's bold color contrasts and Paco Pomet's muted surrealist tones

**Mood & Atmosphere:**

- Simultaneously depressing and oddly hopeful
- Chaotic organization - systems that have beautifully failed
- Warm lighting suggests comfort despite circumstances
- Absurdist touches that hint at magic realism (sticky notes seem to glow slightly)
- Point-and-click adventure game aesthetic - every object suggests a story
- Visual comedy through juxtaposition (organizational tools vs. total chaos)

**Technical Specifications:**

- Resolution: 1920x1080 pixels
- Horizontal composition for point-and-click adventure
- Clear interactive zones for WiFi router (lower left), storage box (center-right), sticky note (upper area)
- Depth: Foreground clutter, midground furniture/boxes, background walls with details
- Perspective: Slight low-angle view emphasizing the "rock bottom" feeling
- Style: Hand-painted digital illustration, expressive brushwork, NOT photorealistic

**Artistic References:**

- **Steve Purcell (Monkey Island)**: Exaggerated proportions, warm cartoon aesthetic, rich environmental storytelling
- **Freddy Pharkas (Sierra)**: Detailed adventure game backgrounds with clear interactive hotspots
- **Paco Pomet**: Surrealist figurative painting - ordinary scenes with mysterious, slightly unsettling elements
- **Alexandre Diop**: Contemporary figurative art with vibrant, unexpected color combinations and emotional depth
- Mix of whimsy and melancholy, humor and profundity

**Avoid:**

- Photorealism or 3D rendering
- Overly dark/depressing tones (keep it warm and hopeful)
- Generic basement clichés
- Clutter without purpose - every item tells Dave's story
- Flat lighting - needs dramatic shadows and warm highlights
