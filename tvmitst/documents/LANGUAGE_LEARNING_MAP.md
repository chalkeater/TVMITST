## "This Very Moment Is The Spanish Teacher"

### Learning Philosophy

Based on research in second language acquisition, we introduce vocabulary in order of:

1. **Frequency** - Most commonly used words first
2. **Emotional Connection** - Words that create personal investment
3. **Contextual Relevance** - Words that make sense in our story world
4. **Cognitive Load** - Simple concepts before complex grammar
